## Clone this repo

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lucasrla/remarkable-utils.git
# --recursive in order to include the remarkable_entware submodule

# if you need a refresher, see: https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitSubmodules/article.html
```

## SSH setup

1. Make sure your reMarkable tablet is connected to the Wi-Fi

2. On your reMarkable tablet, go to `Menu > Settings > Help > About`, then tap on `Copyrights and licenses`. In `General information`, right after the section titled "GPLv3 Compliance", there will be the username (`root`), password and IP addresses needed for `SSH`.

3. Add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host remarkable
  Hostname <IP_ADDRESS_YOU_HAVE_JUST_FOUND>
  User root
  ForwardX11 no
  ForwardAgent no    
```

4. Have a public key ready at `~/.ssh/`

5. Run `ssh-copy-id remarkable`

6. Type your device password. You should see an output similar to:

```
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/Users/<USER>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@192.168.XXX.XXX's password:

Number of key(s) added:        1.
```

7. Let's test it out. Type `ssh remarkable`:

```sh
ssh remarkable
  ｒｅＭａｒｋａｂｌｅ
  ╺━┓┏━╸┏━┓┏━┓   ┏━╸┏━┓┏━┓╻ ╻╻╺┳╸┏━┓┏━┓
  ┏━┛┣╸ ┣┳┛┃ ┃   ┃╺┓┣┳┛┣━┫┃┏┛┃ ┃ ┣━┫┗━┓
  ┗━╸┗━╸╹┗╸┗━┛   ┗━┛╹┗╸╹ ╹┗┛ ╹ ╹ ╹ ╹┗━┛
  reMarkable: ~/
```

Voilà! We're in. 

(Type `exit` to get out.)

### Tweak: auto sleep off

On your device, navigate to `Menu > Settings > Battery` and then turn `Auto sleep` off to prevent the device from sleeping unintentedly.

## Install remarkable_entware

Use the awesome [reMarkable Entware](https://github.com/Evidlo/remarkable_entware) scripts to install `rsync` and other utilities to your reMarkable device:

```sh
cd remarkable_entware

scp entware_install.sh remarkable:

ssh remarkable

./entware_install.sh
  [...]

## Use rsync and crontab to run backups automatically

First, make sure you have `rsync` installed on your machine and that its protocol version is compatible with the one you have just installed in your reMarkable.

```sh
# Edit rsync-remarkable.TEMPLATE.sh according to your needs

# Save it as rsync-remarkable.sh

# Test it out
source rsync-remarkable.sh
```

Then, add it to your `crontab`:

```sh
crontab -e

# Add a new line, like
0 9 * * * source /PATH/TO/rsync-remarkable.sh >> /PATH/TO/rsync-remarkable.log 2>&1

# If you need a refresher: https://crontab.guru
```

## Re-enable remarkable_entware after a reMarkable software update

```sh
cd remarkable_entware

scp entware_reenable.sh remarkable:

ssh remarkable

./entware_reenable.sh
  Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/opt.mount → /etc/systemd/system/opt.mount.

  Info: Entware has been re-enabled.
